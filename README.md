This is a fork of the Wasteland mission with persistence support using the Node.js module [sock-rpc-stats](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sock-rpc-stats), and the [sock.dll / sock.so](https://bitbucket.org/micovery/sock.dll) Arma 3 extension.

The main mission itself is maintained by "Team Wasteland".

For defects related to the mission please visit their [forums](http://forums.a3wasteland.com/), or submit issues directly to their [github repository](https://github.com/A3Wasteland/ArmA3_Wasteland.Altis/issues)

For defects related to persistence, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/micovery/ArmA3_Wasteland.Altis/issues) in this repository.

If you are looking for the prebuilt PBO files head over to the [Release_Files repository](https://github.com/micovery/Release_Files/tree/master/sock-rpc-stats). There also instructions, and a video of how to setup the mission.

===================

ArmA 3 Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival.


The mission is not ready yet, so for now it's just a placeholder :)
